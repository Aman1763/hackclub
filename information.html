	  <p>Zoom has become the primary platform for communication across teachers and students. Typically on a school day, students are supposed to go to their respective classes; similarly, the same structure can be performed on Zoom. Students can engage back to learning with a simple click on a hyperlink. According to EdWeek, the usage of Zoom has "skyrocketed" since the beginning of the pandemic in the US. Zoom also shares features of an in-person classroom. Students can use emojis, raise hand features, etc. to represent their participation in the class. Students can also work in groups through the Breakout rooms feature on Zoom. It is crystal clear that Zoom is one of the most reliable features that teachers and students could depend on: mainly because of its features.</p>

	  <p>When comparing efficiency, Google Classroom is as affective as Zoom. Google Classroom is an organized way of tracking what assignments are due. It fulfills the job of a planner as students see and receive notifications from Gmail. Furthermore, it also allows students to organize assignments into folders, as Google Classroom automatically saves every document on Google Drive. Students can turn in their work: teachers can grade students' work, in addition to providing them constructive feedback through comments. Many schools, including elementary schools, have adopted Google Classroom in response to COVID-19. There's no doubt that Google Classroom would be one of the starting steps to transform the standard school (with textbooks, notebooks, papers) to a paperless version of it.</p>
