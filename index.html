	  <p>Weâ€™ve faced many challenges and shortcomings in the history of civilization: War, famine, hunger, destruction of nature, and the collapse of mighty empires. But one catalyst of societal destruction reigns supreme: pestilence. The truth is that 99% of species that have ever roamed the Earth have gone extinct as a result of the brutal forces of nature that seek to drive us into oblivion. The dinosaurs, early humans, primitive prokaryotes, and prehistoric plants were no exception to this rule. In the current world, it seems to be true that the natural disasters that we face are increasing in their magnitude, and as days pass by, more is becoming uncertain about the future of our society, of our culture, of our heritage, of our children and grandchildren, and of the generations to come.</p> 

          <p>Problems that we face today can be roughly sorted into two categories: long-term and short-term. Both share one commonality: They depend on the impactful decisions that we make today and the policies we enact to ensure the survival of the planet. One important short-term issue that has gained recent notoriety under the headlights of politicians and leaders is the new Coronavirus entitled COVID - 19. With no end in sight, it is crucial to resolve and circumvent future issues that may pose a threat to humanity.</p> 

          <p>However, the virtual environment opens a new realm of opportunities to connect with people across the globe. The virtual environment not only allows us to practice social distancing but also aids us to pace with our daily lives from our house. Several online platforms - Zoom, Google Meets, Microsoft Meetings, Skype - are frequently being used. Schools have adopted these platforms in response to COVID-19. As students and faculty members experiment to produce efficient learning strategies, they often struggle to adapt to these platforms. Hence, we have launched this website to help students and faculty members familiarize themselves with online tools, and provide another platform to communicate across different schools in the nation.</p>
